# FileShare
A simple **local file sharing app** built with **Flask + PyWebView** in **Python**.  
It allows you to upload, delete, and share files over LAN with a QR code.  
Packaged into a desktop app using **PyInstaller**, so users can run it without installing Python.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation (Development)

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KCoder-programming/FileShare.git
   cd FileShare
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

### Note (for advance users and developers)

1. This app uses Flaskâ€™s development server, which is fine for local/LAN usage.
2. Do not expose it directly to the internet. If you want to host it, use a production WSGI server
3. In linux if you get error:
   ```
   You must have either QT or GTK with Python extensions installed in order to use pywebview.
   ```
   to remove error with QT method-
   
   a) Change the gui option to 'qt'  at last line of code in app.py instead of 'edgechromium'
      ```python
      webview.start(icon=get_resource_path(path.join("static", "icon.ico")), gui='edgechromium')   # Windows (Edge)
      webview.start(icon=get_resource_path(path.join("static", "icon.ico")), gui='qt')             # Linux (QtWebEngine)
      ```
   b) For Qt: Easiest fix, run the command in terminal
      ```bash
      pip install pywebview[qt]
      ```
