# FileShare
A simple **local file sharing app** built with **Flask + PyWebView** in **Python**.  
It allows you to upload, delete, and share files over LAN with a QR code.  
Packaged into a desktop app using **PyInstaller**, so users can run it without installing Python.

---

## Features
- Upload multiple files from browser
- Remove uploaded files
- Automatically generates a QR code for LAN access to scan and connect
- Cross-platform (Windows/Linux/Android)
- Packaged into `.exe` with PyInstaller
- Embedded WebView instead of external browser
- Independent of number of device connected

This app uses Flaskâ€™s development server, which is fine for local/LAN usage.

Do not expose it directly to the internet. If you want to host it, use a production WSGI server
